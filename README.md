## Project Overview

This project was created with the intent of giving a PCB of this device to learning students and having them practice soldering on the components to see if they can get it to work. After the students made the PCB functional, they were  educated on why and how the board works by showing them schematics and the PCB.

## Educational Value Added

* Circuit design proccess
* Schematic design -- Flux and Multisim
* PCB design -- Flux
* Circuit simulations -- Falstad
* Circuit prototyping

## Tasks

* Create a block diagram
* Research components/circuits
* Create a schematic
* Simulate/test the schematic
* Iterate until the schematic functions properly
* Design PCB from the schematic
* Fabricate, populate, and test the PCB
* Iterate until PCB is functional and efficient

## Design Decisions



## Design Misc
